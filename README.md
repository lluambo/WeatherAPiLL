# Weather APill
This is a simple Python code that gets the API from open weather and tells you the temperature with high and low temps of a city.
The requests library is required so remember to install that, more info can be extracted but this is a proof of concept to get better at API usage.
You can make a free account and use the API from https://openweathermap.org.
